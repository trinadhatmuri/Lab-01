## Assignment:

Write a program in C to check if a number is prime (feel free to utilize https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).

1. Define a integer variable *givenNumber*.

2. Use the *scanf()* function to read the integer variable *givenNumber*.

3. Use if-conditional statements to find out if *givenNumber* is prime.

4. Based on the result, print *"The given number is prime."* or *"The given number is not prime."*.

## Optional:

- Utilize the sqrt() function from the math.h header file in your solution.

- Consider some edge cases (e.g. user gives a floating point number). Respond appropriately to each.

- If you have not, create a function 'checkIfPrime'. Move your code to it, and call it in the main function.

- Make 'checkIfPrime' a recursive function *'recursiveCheckIfPrime'* that checks if a number is prime.
